1. Create the above tables, and populate them with the instances.
For this, you can do it by using the query commands directly in the mysql environment. 
To login in directly to the mysql environment, you use the following at the command line:
             mysql –h mysql.cs.mun.ca –u <username> -p <password>


*pid is supposed to be integer, but given data requires string
	therefore, both sid and pid are VARCHAR
CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
	sid VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, 
	sname VARCHAR(20),
	address VARCHAR(20)
	PRIMARY KEY (sid)
);
CREATE TABLE Parts (
	pid VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, 
	pname VARCHAR(20),
	color VARCHAR(10)
	PRIMARY KEY (pid)
);
CREATE TABLE Catalog (
	sid VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, 
	pid VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	cost DOUBLE(10,2)
	PRIMARY KEY (sid, pid)
);

INSERT INTO Suppliers VALUES
    ('111', 'John Smith', '1 Elizabeth Ave'), ('222', 'Linda Wang', '20 Main Street'),
    ('333', 'Paul Justin', '150 Water Street'), ('444', 'Andy Brown', '1 Elizabeth Ave'),
    ('555', 'Bob Lee', '10 Governor Road'), ('666', 'Lisa Reed', '10 Governor Road');
INSERT INTO Parts VALUES
    ('P1', 'Mother board', 'Grey'), ('P2', 'CPU-AMD', 'White'),
    ('P3', 'Case', 'Grey'), ('P4', 'Monitor', 'White'), ('P5', 'Cable', 'Red');
INSERT INTO Catalog VALUES
    ('111', 'P1', 300), ('111', 'P3', 50), ('111', 'P4', 500), 
    ('222', 'P1', 350), ('222', 'P2', 200), ('222', 'P3', 70), ('222', 'P5', 30), 
    ('333', 'P2', 210), ('333', 'P3', 56),

2.   Implement the following types of queries as web applications:

	SELECT        [DISTINCT]  target-list
	FROM         relation-list
	WHERE        qualification
	GROUP BY  grouping-list
	HAVING      group-qualification

a) Given the name of a part, retrieve the information about each supplier who supplied it. This 
	information can be any subset of the supplier’s id, supplier’s name, address, and the 
	cost the supplier charged for that part.
ANSWER:
	SELECT S.*, C.cost
	FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C, Parts P
	WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.pid = P.pid AND P.pname = [name]

(SEEMS CORRECT)

b) Given the cost, retrieve the names of the suppliers who have ever supplied a part with 
	that cost or higher. 
ANSWER:
*This query says "ever supplied" may have meant never?
NEVER:
	SELECT S.sname					//WRONG
	FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
	WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.cost < [cost]
OR
	SELECT S.sname
	FROM Suppliers S
	WHERE S.sid NOT IN ( SELECT S.sid
			     FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
			     WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.cost >= [cost] )

- - - -
EVER:
	SELECT DISTINCT S.sname			//assume no duplicate names
	FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
	WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.cost >= [cost]
OR
	SELECT S.sid, S.sname
	FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
	WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.cost >= [cost]
	GROUP BY S.sid
OR
	SELECT S.sname
	FROM Suppliers S
	WHERE S.sid IN ( SELECT S.sid
			FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
			WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.cost >= [cost] )

(SEEMS CORRECT)

c) Given the pid, retrieve the names and addresses for the suppliers who charge the most 
	for that part.
ANSWER:
	SELECT Tmp.sname, Tmp.address
	FROM ( SELECT S.*, C.cost			//cA
		FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
		WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.pid = [pid] ) AS Tmp //ppl who supply [pid]
	WHERE Tmp.cost = (SELECT MAX(Tmp.cost)	//cB
			  FROM Tmp )

	DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS Tmp
	CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Tmp
		(SELECT S.*, C.cost
		FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C
		WHERE S.sid = C.sid AND C.pid = [pid]);
	DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS Tmp2
	CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE Tmp2 (SELECT MAX(Tmp.cost) as maxCost FROM Tmp);
	SELECT Tmp.sname, Tmp.address
	FROM Tmp
	WHERE Tmp.cost = Tmp2.maxCost;			//ALMOST

OR

	SELECT  S.sname, S.address
	FROM Suppliers S, Catalog C, Parts P
	WHERE C.pid = P.pid AND C.sid = S.sid AND P.pid = [pid] AND C.cost = (
		SELECT MAX(C1.cost)
		FROM Catalog C1
		WHERE C1.pid = P.pid);
(SEEMS CORRECT)

d) Given the color and address, retrieve the names of the parts with that color which were 
	supplied by all the suppliers in the given address.

	FROM  Parts P
	WHERE  NOT EXISTS ( (SELECT  S.sid		//All suppliers at given address

e) Given the address, retrieve the sids and names of the suppliers in that address who do not 
	supply any part.
ANSWER:
	SELECT  S.sid		//All suppliers at given address
	FROM  Suppliers S
	WHERE  S.address = [address] AND S.sid NOT IN (
			SELECT C.sid,		//All suppliers who sell a part
